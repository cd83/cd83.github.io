I am a DevOps Engineer with a passion for containerization, automation, and Infrastructure as Code. I'm a Windows / Powershell guy but can Linux and Bash script just the same. My current focus is Azure DevOps Projects (CI/CD Pipelines), Terraform, and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

I believe that collaboration and communication are the keys to success across an organization. I continually strive to learn new technologies and work with team members to facilitate understanding between roles.
